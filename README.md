**Gravity Simulations**

A collection of small Python simulations that model particles interacting under mutual attraction (gravity-like forces). These scripts explore different approaches (simple numeric integration, Pygame visuals, Pymunk physics, and a Panda3D 3D demonstrator).

**Author note**: I was trying to simulate particles acting under the force of attraction between them and their behaviours — it's fun to watch.

**Files**
- **`2D_gravity_sim.py`**: A compact Pygame + NumPy 2D particle simulator. Uses pairwise inverse-square attraction, simple collision handling, and basic elastic responses. Prompts for the number of particles on start (keep <= 20 for good performance).
- **`N-Body_sim.py`**: A more configurable N-body demo using NumPy and pure Python; includes Verlet integration, softening, and collision handling. Good for larger particle counts and experimenting with integration/softening constants.
- **`simulation.py`**: Similar to `N-Body_sim.py` but with different default constants and mass/radius ranges; also uses Velocity Verlet integration and collision response.
- **`nbody_sim.py`** and **`nbody.py`**: Pymunk-based simulations that create dynamic Pymunk bodies and apply mutual gravitational forces each step. These render using Pymunk's Pygame debug draw. Requires `pymunk`.
- **`sim.py`**: A Panda3D-based 3D scene with a simple pairwise attraction implementation and bounce/clamp logic. Looks for a `models/scene.gltf` model (falls back to a placeholder if not found). Requires `panda3d`.
- **`slingshots_effect.py`**: A Pygame interactive demo where you click to place and launch spacecraft that feel gravitational pull from a central planet (slingshot effect). Background is black.

**Dependencies**
- Python 3.8+ (your environment shows multiple venvs; pick one and activate it)
- numpy
- pygame
- pymunk (for `nbody.py` / `nbody_sim.py`)
- panda3d (for `sim.py`, optional)

Install dependencies quickly:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install numpy pygame pymunk
# Optional: pip install panda3d
```

**How to run**
- Simple Pygame demos (no extra deps besides `pygame` + `numpy`):

```bash
python 2D_gravity_sim.py
python N-Body_sim.py
python simulation.py
python slingshots_effect.py
```

- Pymunk demos:

```bash
pip install pymunk
python nbody.py
python nbody_sim.py
```

- Panda3D demo (optional):

```bash
pip install panda3d
python sim.py
```

**Notes & tips**
- Many scripts accept or prompt for a particle count; large counts (>>50) can be slow because pairwise O(n^2) forces are computed.
- To experiment with behaviour, tweak constants near the top of each file: gravitational constant (`G`), time step (`DT`), and collision/elasticity settings.
- `sim.py` will try to load `models/scene.gltf` from a `models` folder. If you don't have models, the script falls back to a placeholder node.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add a `requirements.txt` and a small launcher script.
- Add a simple generated-sphere fallback in `sim.py` so particles are always visible without external models.
